This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a multimodal transformer model with a large action model. The provided code structure and examples serve as a foundation for further development and experimentation. Given the complexity of the project, 
it's important to iterate and refine each component while leveraging the power of pre-trained models and transfer learning to achieve the best results.

Feel free to expand upon this structure by adding more sophisticated models, advanced data processing techniques, or deploying the model in real-world applications!
